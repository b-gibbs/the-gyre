<strong>"Jack of all trades, master of none"</strong> is a figure of speech used in reference to a person who has dabbled in many skills, rather than gaining expertise by focusing on one.
<br /><br /> 
The shortened version "a jack of all trades" is often a compliment for a person who...has a very good broad knowledge. They may be a master of integration, as such an individual who knows enough from many...skills to be able to bring the individual's disciplines together in a practical manner. This person is a generalist rather than a specialist.

This is a great description of a product manager. A product manager should have accounts on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com) , [Github](https://github.com), [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com) and maybe [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com).

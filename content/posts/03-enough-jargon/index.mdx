While researching an article on product strategy, I’ve come across several articles that confuse and conflate OKRs and KPIs. A common mistake is to think that they are comparable and that the difference between them needs to be explained. Often, the author concludes that the two are compatible, but that KPIs are appropriate in some cases, while others are better suited for OKRs.

Performance indicators are metrics; a measure of how a business or an area of the business is performing. If leadership decides a particular metric is important to the business, it’s a key performance indicator, or KPI. 

“OKR” stands for Objective and Key Results. The objective is a clearly defined goal. In other words, it is not a metric, but an aspiration. Key results are specific, concrete, measurable sub-goals we have determined need to be achieved in order to achieve our objective. We can declare our objective achieved once we have completed each of the key results. By definition, key results are KPIs—important measures of performance. Objectives are also often KPIs, but may be more conceptual goals that are not easily measured, such “improve customer service”.

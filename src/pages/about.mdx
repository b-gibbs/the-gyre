A gyre (pronounced with a soft 'g', as in giraffe or gyrate) is a circular ocean current formed by the Earth's wind patterns and the forces created by the rotation of the planet.<br/>

The url for this site (the gyre) is a nod to The Second Coming, a poem by William Butler Yeats.

Turning and turning in the widening gyre<br/> 
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br/>
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br/>
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br/>
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere<br/>   
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br/>
The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br/>   
Are full of passionate intensity.<br/>
<br/>
Surely some revelation is at hand;<br/>
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.<br/>   
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out<br/>   
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi<br/>
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert<br/>   
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br/>   
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,<br/>   
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br/>   
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.<br/>   
The darkness drops again; but now I know<br/>   
That twenty centuries of stony sleep<br/>
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br/>   
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br/>   
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?<br/>
